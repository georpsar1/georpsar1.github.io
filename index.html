                    Engineering from the University of Peloponnese, where my thesis explored the realm of

                    Hello! I'm George, a computer engineer from Crete, Greece. Computer and language nerd who used to work on a non-tech company as a software developer, I have experience on both the technical and business side of things. I hold a Computer Engineering degree from the University of Peloponnese, where I
                    specialized in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing through my thesis work. Aside from that I like to play music and solve puzzles. Top 1% minesweeper player.

                    Throughout my time in - well, mostly outside of - education, I've tinkered in various domains, developing applications ranging
                    from an Android horoscope app to a genetic algorithm visualizer. My experience includes working
                    with different technologies and platforms, from Android Studio and Flutter to Rust, WebAssembly,
                    and the Power Platform.

                    These days, I am focused on SAP technologies. Please refer to my demos tab for a showcase of some things I've built.</p>
